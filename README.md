# neuralnet_implementations
My implementations of basic neural networks and a convolutional net. Does not use any pre-made libraries. Skeleton from 231n--credit to this class for the general project structure!

Update comming with more detailed readme of what I have done. Currently working on building convnet from scratch

for interesting files, see:
-'231n/layers.py' for utility functions such as forward and back prop, relu, batch normalization
-'231n/optim.py' for stochastic gradient descent, adam implementations
-'231n/classifiers/fc_net.py' for a neural net using my built utilities to train on CIFAR 10 data!
